# iOSReusableComponents

A collection of miscellaneous code snippets and classes with units tests and partially mock categories. Most need definitely customization and / or refactoring before reuse, e.g. some might depend on unpublished classes or storyboards. Test classes depend on [OCAdditions](https://github.com/michaelkamphausen/OCAdditions).
